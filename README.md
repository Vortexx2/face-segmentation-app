# Face Segmentation App Using OpenCV

- Implements an OpenCV face segmentation Haar cascade as an API, along with a frontend to display the outputs of the API.
- User takes an image from their webcam -> the image is sent to the server -> face segmentation is performed on it and is sent back to the user -> segmented image is displayed to the user.
