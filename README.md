# Face Segmentation App Using OpenCV

- Implements an OpenCV face segmentation Haar cascade as an API, along with a frontend to display the outputs of the API.
- User takes an image from their webcam -> the image is sent to the server -> face segmentation is performed on it and is sent back to the user -> segmented image is displayed to the user.

## Runthrough

A basic runthrough is displayed below:

## Features To Implement

- Diving deeper into DL, I want to implement multiple segmentation algorithms.
- Give user option ability to choose the algorithm that will be used to perform segmentation.
- Allow user to download the segmented images, **letting the user grasp through a basic hands on approach to image segmentation using different algorithms**.
